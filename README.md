## Description

I'm building an e-commerse website to teach myself the techologies concepts.
This will be an application where you can buy and sell plants.

## Tech Stack

### Frontend

- [ ] Next.js for SSR and routing
- [ ] React Hooks
- [ ] React-Apollo 
- [ ] CSS-in-JS with Emotion
- [ ] Jest and testing-library
- [ ] Apollo Client for state

### Backend
